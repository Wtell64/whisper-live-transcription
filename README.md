# whisper-live-transcription
A small personal project to use Whisper AI to make live transcriptions

It is a cumbersome code at the moment and will work on it on my free time to make the code more neat.

There is also a problem with the code where live transcription stops after 25 to 30 seconds. 

#To use:

First run the transcribe.py and wait for the model to initialize and wait for a recording. Then run the record.py to record wav files.

#To Do

Make the code mode neat
Make the code work for audios longer than 30 seconds.
